Source-1-Games
==============

This is the README for the Source 1 based games.  Source 1 based games include Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike:Source.

Please use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Team Fortress 2, Count-Strike:Source and the Source 1 Engine.

Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike:Source or any other Source 1 game.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Source 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- which game you're reporting the bug on (TF2, CS:S, all)
- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your Linux distro
- your Desktop/Window Manager
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

Feature Requests
-------------------

If you are asking for a new feature or enhancement for a game, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues) to see if it has already been asked for. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has been asked for, go ahead and put your 2 cents in for it in the existing entry.

If it has not been asked for, create a new issue with at least the following information:

 - The game your asking for the enhancement
 - A clear description of what exactly you want
 - Justification as to why this is something that is needed
 - Why we should do this feature rather than doing some other feature on the list

Remember that just because you ask for a feature improvement doesn't mean we'll get to it.  We're mostly going to be focused on existing bugs rather than enhancing these games.  That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here.  Be clear.  Be concise.

Driver Contact Information
--------------------------

Some of the issue you may be experiencing are due to the various video drivers.  Here is an incomplete list of places that you might be able to file bugs or get additional help:

### AMD

AMD Steam Linux forum for reporting **compatibility and performance issues with AMD hardware**:

http://devgurus.amd.com/community/steam-linux

The AMD Open Source driver is a part of Mesa, so use the links under "Intel" to report issues with it.

### Intel

For discussions, there is the mesa-users email list:

http://mesa3d.org/lists.html

Bugs and feature requests should be logged in bugzilla:

http://mesa3d.org/bugs.html

### NVIDIA

NVIDIA supported drivers
- https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/98

Open Source NVIDIA driver (nouveau)
- http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FrontPage

If you know of any other places, please let us know.

Known Video Driver/Card issues:
----------------------------------

### NVIDIA

6xxx and 7xxx hardware have been EOL'd. The code specific to these GPUs isn't even compiled into drivers anymore.

6xxx and 7xxx GPUs are incapable of performing sRGB functionality needed by Source Engine titles when being driven by OpenGL. (The sRGB behavior as specified in OpenGL is slightly different than the behavior that was actually unspecified in D3D9, which is why this works in D3D9 but not in OpenGL).
